      <p>
        Camara Kenya is the charity working together with young people
        to create opportunities for rewarding futures. Without these
        opportunities, one in five young people in Kenya face living in poverty;
        unable to reach their potential. We value the strength and individuality
        of every young person we encounter. We have worked in Kenya, through
        close collaborations with Kenyan Government and
        Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), communities and individuals since
        2001 to create real, lasting change at community and individual level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work includes providing practical trade and business skills training
        alongside tailored well-being support, which enables young people to
        overcome past traumas and realise their ambitions. Together we break the
        cycle of poverty and inequality. We support young people and their
        families through a network of staff, graduates, mentors, supporters and
        volunteers, to realise their potential.
      </p>

        Every person deserves the opportunity to build a self-reliant,
        bright, future.
