      <span> Nutritious cooked meals </span>

      <p>
        Students can’t focus on learning when they’re hungry, for many young
        people the only meals they eat are at Seed of Hope.
      </p>
      <span>Menstrual hygiene packs</span>

      <p>
        – every month girls miss lessons because they’re on their period and
        can’t afford sanitary pads, we ensure every girl has menstrual hygiene
        packs every month and provide training sessions so they understand
        what’s happening to their bodies.
      </p>
      <span>Counselling </span>

      <p>
        Many young people joining Seed of Hope have experienced significant
        trauma, abuse, bereavement and depression. They can’t focus on learning
        when they are dealing with significant mental health issues. We provide
        group and individual counselling to all students to help them to process
        what they’ve been through and find ways to cope and build resilience.
      </p>
      <span>Graduate support </span>
      <p>
        We run a mentorship project matching new graduates with former graduates
        who are running successful businesses to provide peer support and share
        their learning. We have just launched an Educational Business Hub in
        Kitui where graduates can launch their businesses. They have access to
        all of the tools, equipment, computers and support they need to make the
        transition from learning to running a successful small business.
