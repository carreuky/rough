        <h1>Teacher training and sensitization</h1>
        <h1>Rural Area</h1>
        <img src="./pictures/teacher.jpg" alt="bikes" srcset="" />

        <p>Teacher training refers to any support and capacity building which enables teachers and other education personnel to effectively instruct and assess learners on the curricula. Teacher development programs are based on actual and evolving needs of both teachers and learners. There should be a clear link between the curriculum, learning rights, needs of students and their families, and teacher training and continued teacher support.</p>
        <h1>Empower, Engage, Educate in Rural Kenya!</h1>
        <h1>Nairobi</h1>
        <p>
        Imagine students in rural Kenya using computers and reading books! The Kenya Connect Learning Resource Center engages and empowers students and teachers from our 63 partner schools through access to technology including STEAM programs and computer literacy for girls and boys . This coupled with programs like KC's reusable sanitary pads and empowerment programs for girls and our rent-to-own solar light and library program to boost literacy are making a profound difference in rural Kenya.

        <h1>Long-Term Food Security for 4000 Samburus in Kenya</h1>
        <h1>Samburu</h1>

        <p>
            SFK aims to sustainably bring back water, forest and life to degraded lands in Samburu County, Kenya, supporting local populations towards food self-sufficiency. The goal is to create forests of indigenous, food-producing trees that will provide long-term food security to the Samburu tribe while simultaneously curbing climate change. This is achieved through innovative training at our centre, as well as the distribution, cooperative planting and follow-up care of tree seedlings in the community.
